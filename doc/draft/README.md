blockjs Documentation - Draft Version
=====================================

Simplified Diagram Model
----------------

Simplified Model presents the code as components more naturally but will need 
more work to build these components.

Generic Diagram Model
-------------

Generic Model was the first draft I made and presents the JavaScript code as 
components almost 1-to-1.
