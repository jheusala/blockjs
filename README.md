blockjs IDE
================================

blockjs is (going to be) a graphical component IDE (Integrated Development 
Environment) for JavaScript and [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org). Programming 
will be done by combining graphical components rather than writing traditional 
text files. Complete application source code will look like [block 
diagrams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_diagram) or [schematic 
diagrams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schematics).

This project will be a web-based application written in JavaScript and with 
Node.js. License is [GPL version 3](https://github.com/jheusala/blockjs/blob/master/COPYING).

Project Status
-------------

At the moment I am gathering ideas and comments how the blocks should be 
presented (see 
[draft](https://github.com/jheusala/blockjs/blob/master/doc/draft-of-component-specs.png)) 
and doing some small concept testing.

Main parts of the blockjs
-------------------------
* Application Editor
* Block catalogs
* Visual UI editor for web
* Block and catalog editors

Block Catalogs
--------------
* Standard ECMAScript blocks
* Client-side blocks
* Node.js blocks
* NPM blocks
